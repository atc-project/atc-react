  A User-Agent string is a piece of metadata associated with the header of a HTTP request and is used for content negotiation as outlined within [RFC1945](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#page-46).  User-agents may often be overlooked by adversaries, and as such provide a valuable point of investigation.

  1. Retrieve the user-agent from the HTTP header.
  2. Using the below methodology as a reference make a judgement as to whether the user-agent provided is suspicious or not. 

  **Indications of suspicious user-agents based upon string analysis:**

  * The user-agent is left empty.
  * The user-agent contains typos or deviations in capitilisation that are different from known good user-agents.
  * The user-agent contains a sequence of random characters or "gibberish" akin to those found within MITRE ATT&CK [T1568.002](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1568/002/).  
  * The user-agent contains code that would execute an XSS or SQL Injection attack.
  
  **Indications of suspicious user-agents based upon reputational analysis:**

  * The user-agent is not listed as a popular user-agent on reference materials such as [WhatIsMyBrowser](https://developers.whatismybrowser.com/useragents/explore/).
  * It should be noted that there is value in engaging with the community on particular User-Agents, and this can often be done by leveraging a search engine such as Google.

   **Contextualise your findings with knowledge from your environment.**

  * Consider whether the user-agent is relevant for your SoE environment.  For instance, the presence of Mac OS X user-agents in a Windows only environment.
  * Consider performing long-tail analysis or clustering to identify anomalies within your environment.

  ### Important Considerations
  * User-Agents are client-side generated and can be easily spoofed.  Many adversaries will default to leveraging known-good user-agents to hide activity.
  * User-Agent analysis should be combined with other analysis to improve the fidelity of the signal. It is well known that many legitimate applications (especially custom applications) will omit user-agent strings or utilise defaults associated with the popular libraries.
